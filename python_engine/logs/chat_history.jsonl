Here are some simple tips:\n\n1. **Clean Regularly**: Use a soft brush or cloth to remove dirt and dust. For deeper cleaning, use a damp cloth and mild soap, then let them air dry.\n\n2. **Condition**: Apply a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather supple and prevent cracking.\n\n3. **Polish**: Use a good quality shoe polish that matches the color of your shoes. This helps restore shine and provides a protective layer.\n\n4. **Protect**: Consider using a water-repellent spray to protect against moisture and stains.\n\n5. **Store Properly**: Keep your shoes in a cool, dry place. Use shoe trees to maintain their shape and absorb moisture.\n\n6. **Rotate Wear**: If possible, rotate your shoes to give each pair time to breathe and recover.\n\nFollowing these steps will help keep your leather shoes in top condition!
